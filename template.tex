\Notice{Please Don't make Changes to this Version. Building new Outline. Will send link as soon as possible}  Lack of dopamine is a known cause of Parkinson's as well as other illnesses.  Though it is believed that Parkinson's Disease is due to a lack of dopamine in the Nigrostriatal Dopaminergic pathway, current medications and treatments which directly treat the lack of dopamine within the pathways are ineffective at best.  Our model introduces a theory to explain the lack of dopamine within the Nigrostriatal Dopaminergic pathway in Parkinson's patients. Dopamine is synthesized from its mirror image, L-DOPA which is created both within the digestive system and kidneys and transported via the circulatory system through the blood brain barrier to the Dopaminergic Pathways where it is transported directly to the neuron via the transport protein AADC before being synthesized into dopamine.  It has long been known that L-DOPA is processed en-masse via the kidneys, specifically within the Proximal Tubule Cells.  However, the method by which L-DOPA is stored and transported within these Proximal Tubule Cells is poorly understood and no mechanistic model currently exists.  The following provides a comprehensive mechanistic model for the synthesis, transport and uptake of dopamine within the body.  Additionally our simulations show an over production of dopamine in the kidneys leaves little L-DOPA for synthesis into dopamine within the Nigrostriatal Pathway. Wrap this up at the end... Include keywords, PACS and mathematical subject classification numbers as needed.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:1}
\todo{needs editing}

There lacks a mechanistic model of Dopamine that follows the pathway from start to finish. The Dopamine cycle itself is difficult to understand and current research is focusing on gaining a deeper understanding of what goes on (CITATION NEEDED). A mechanistic model would help to tell the story and allow for manipulations, changes, and simulations along each step in order to test hypotheses, drug treatment options, and simply gain a better overall understanding of what Dopamine is doing before it interacts with our brain. A good model would allow the mathematics to drive science as opposed to science driving applied mathematics (Bill paraphrase, not sure how that sounds...).Dopamine has been difficult for researchers to fully understand despite over 50 years of research on the topic. Major progress has been made but it seems the more that is discovered about Dopamine the more important Dopamine becomes. Dopamine is now known to effect mood, motor function, cognition, addiction, and reward \cite{Ref34}. \\
%
\indent Dopamine affects people at every moment of every day, it is no wonder why researchers have worked so hard on understanding it. This model does not attempt to describe the Dopaminergic pathways (right? Unless we want to add that in but I think it's a different paper.) but simply to tell the story of Dopamine from the gut, through the gut wall into the blood, and then from the blood vessels through the blood brain barrier and into the brain. The journey must then start with Tyrosine, a nonessential amino acid. Humans get Tyrosine from food sources such as many meats and dairy products. Tyrosine is also created from Phenylalanine (Wikipedia, could definitely be more specific here.) Tyrosine together with Tyrosine Hydroxylase create L-DOPA. This reaction takes place in the gut, the blood, and in the brain. This hydroxylation (is that the right word?) is the rate limiting step in the production of Dopamine (Wikipedia). Tyrosine that hasn't been used up in this or any other reaction travel through the gut wall as well as the L-DOPA that was created. Once in the blood stream, the reaction of Tyrosine and Tyrosine Hydroxylase continues to create more L-DOPA on the way to the brain. Once at the blood brain barrier, any L-DOPA that has turned into Dopamine cannot pass the blood brain barrier due to a lack of the existence of a transport protein. The leftover L-DOPA, Tyrosine, and Tyrosine Hydroxylase then pass through the blood brain barrier via transport proteins. Once in the brain the dopamine that will later pass through the dopaminergic pathways in the brain is finally created via L-DOPA reacting with Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase, AADC for short. Once the dopamine is created in the dopaminergic cells (is this right?) it is transfered into one of 4 pathways and this is pretty much where my knowledge stops but also our research kinda stops too so that's good! \\
The research team was created at UT Austin through what I would call a chance encounter with one of the authors during a separate research meeting with two of the other authors. Regular research meetings began at the end of the Spring 2016 semester and throughout Summer 2016 to work on the modeling of the dopamine cycle. The researchers began working to understand the dopamine cycle and where certain reactions took place in the body and what Dopamine precursors should be focused on. It was decided to focus on following the path of Dopamine and its precursors from ingestion, into the blood stream, and finally into the brain. Because of the complexity of the dopaminergic pathways in the brain it was decided to omit a model for this process and save it for another paper.

\subsection{Validity}
\todo{Proofs?}

The Validity in our model comes from well known biological interactions such as the Michaelis-Menten model for transport through a cell wall and the assumption or simplification that most reactions we deal with abide by the law of mass action. More complex models could be used for these rates in attempt to gain a more accurate model if desired. Our goal is not to create the best model but the first, to lay the ground work. The justification for modeling cell wall transport via Michaelis-Menten can be found elsewhere (Some source cited talking about MM). 
Probably need to go in and add specifics.
Our model was built upon rates, observed values from prior research, and math.  It is valid because bottom up approach, magic, and math.  We support our hypotheses with simulations and magic.  Our predictions are based upon our simulations and magic.

%
\paragraph{Synthesis in the Dopaminergic Pathways} \hfill

We let the total amount of L-DOPA which could potentially be successfully synthesized within the cumulative Dopaminergic Pathways equal 1.
  This is:
$$\beta_1 \cdot [D_1] + \beta_2[D_2] \cdot [D_2] + \beta_3 \cdot [D_3] + \beta_4 \cdot [D_4] = 1.$$
  Now letting: $$\gamma =\beta_1[D_1]$$ \\ represent the amount of L-DOPA which could be successfully synthesized into dopamine specifically within the Nigrostriatal Pathway, we have: 
%--------------------------------Equation 5----------------------------
\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:5}
  \gamma = \beta_1[D_1] = 1- [\beta_2[D_2] \cdot [D_2] + \beta_3 \cdot [D_3] + \beta_4 \cdot [D_4]]
  \end{equation}

Which is our \textit{Theoretical Value Gamma}.  We will bifurcate around the theoretical value  $\gamma$ in Section \ref{sec:6} when discussing the up and down regulation of salt in the renal dopamine system in order to show the excess or shortage of L-DOPA available for transport and ultimately, synthesis, into dopamine within the Nigrostriatal Pathway.

\section{ Michaelis Menten Kinetics}
\label{sec:3}
\todo{Clean up MM Explanation}

In our models we forego Mass Action Kinetics for Michaelis Menten Kinetics.  This allows for a better simulation since our models are concerned with initial values for tyrosine, AADC, tryptophan and various other substrates, enzymes, and intermediate complexes.
%~~~~~~ Subsection 3.1 ~~~~~
%----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Rates in Initial Value Problems}
%---------------------------Equation 1: Kidney Mentens------------------
Now, in Equation \ref{eq:1}, $$[MM]_{L_{Kidney}}^{Outward}$$ represents the Michaelis Menten Kinetics for the synthesis of L-DOPA in the kidneys from incoming substrates.  $$[MM]_{L_{Kidney}}^{Apical Secretions}$$ represents the synthesis of L-DOPA into Dopamine which leaves the system through Apical Secretions via the Proximal Tubule Cell. \cite{Ref28} \cite{Ref29}
%--------------------------Equation 2: G.I. Tract Mentens---------------
In Equation \ref{eq:2} $$[MM]_{L_{Gut}}^{Blood}$$ represents the Michaelis Menten Kinetics for the synthesis of L-DOPA from the Gastroinestinal Tract into Dopamine in the Circulatory System. 
%--------------------------Equation 3: Blood Mentens-------------------
In Equation \ref{eq:3} $$[MM]_{L_{Gut}}^{Blood}$$ represents the Michaelis Menten Kinetics for the synthesis of L-DOPA in the blood from substrates in the gastrointestinal tract. $$[MM]_{T_{Gut}}$$ represents the Michaelis Menten Kinetics for the synthesis of Tyrosine in the gastrointestinal tract from substrates.  $$[MM]_{L_{Brain}}$$ represents the Michaelis Menten Kinetics for the synthesis of L-DOPA into Dopamine within the Dopaminergic Pathways, specifically the Nigrostriatal Pathway.
%~~~~~~ Subsection 3.2 ~~~~~
\subsection{The Theoretical Value Gamma}                                 
Recall from Equation \ref{eq:5} this is equivalent to our Theoretical Value Gamma, or: $$\gamma = \beta_1 [D_1].$$  
%
Now, the rate at which not only $\gamma$ is produced, but the rates at which all of the L-DOPA is produced in each system of IVP's is governed by Michaelis-Menten Kinetics.  We will refer to the nested program that simulates these reactions as the \textit{Michaelis-Menten Kinetics function}.  The Michaelis-Menten Kinetics function forms the foundation of the IVPs and ODEs used in our model, and an exploration of differences between the various Michaelis-Menten rates will be the basis of the simulations seen later in Section \ref{sec:6} and of the discussions in Section \ref{sec:8}.

What we refer to as the Michaelis-Menten Kinetics function is a set of differential equations and their graphical outputs plotted over time for any arbitrary product, substrate, enzyme and intermediate complex.  This could be L-DOPA, Dopamine, Tyrosine, or Phenylalanine.

%~~~~~~ Subsection 3.3 ~~~~~
\subsection{Generalized Michaelis-Menten Kinetics}

Given Particular initial values, and rates the Michaelis-Menten Kinetics function models specific products, substrates, enzymes, and intermediate complexes. All initial values and rates used in the initial simulations acting as our "Control" values, with which we will compare our "altered" values in Section \ref{sec:6} are set to currently accepted standard rates and values

They are in dimensions of time in seconds and concentration in moles, or Molarity.
%
The Michaelis-Menten Kinetics function consists of a system of four non-linear ordinary differential equations which use the application of the law of mass action, that defines the rate of reactants with time proportional to the product of the concentrations of the reactants \cite{Ref28}.

\label{eq:8}
k_1 \approx 10^9, \quad k_2 \approx 10^5, \quad k_3 \approx 10^3

%
\quad Though these rates will be adjusted in Section \ref{sec:4} the standardized rates provide a few insights to the behavior of the system. The key idea is, "some reactions are very fast compared to others and therefore can equilibrate quickly, essentially being in a steady state" \cite{Ref28} {(Logan et al. 124)}.

%~~~~~~ Subsection 3.5 ~~~~~~
\subsection{The Quasi-steady State Assumption}
\paragraph{}
"The quasi-steady state assumption is the assumption the second reaction equilibrates so quickly that we can take, approximately, 
$$\od{C}{\tau} = 0.$$
Thus, in the quasi-steady state, the second equation reduces to an algebraic equation as follows: 
$$
C = \frac{k_1 \cdot E_0 \cdot S}{k_3 + k_2 + k_1 \cdot S}
\\
= \frac{E_0 \cdot S}{K_m + S'}
$$

\ZeroNote{K_m = \frac{k_3 + k_2}{k_1} \text{, is known as the Michaelis-Menten constant.}}
%
substituting back into \ref{eq:6} we obtain the simplified equation
% 
$$\od{S}{\tau} = -\frac{V_m \cdot S}{K_m + S}, \quad V_m=k_3 \cdot E_0.$$
%
Through separation of variables, Equation \ref{eq:5} can be solved implicitly for $S$ which allows for the measurement of the speed of the reaction to be defined by the rate the product is formed.  This is: 
%--------------------------------Equation 9-------------------------------
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:9}
V = \od{P}{\tau} = k_3 \cdot C = {V_m \cdot S}{K_m + S}
\end{equation}
Equation \ref{eq:8} is known as the \textbf{Michaelis-Menten Law} (Logan, 195)

\subsection{Gastrointestinal System} \hfill

\indent Equation \ref{eq:10} models the production, usage, and transport of Tyrosine in the gut and into the blood stream. The $-\alpha_1*T_G*T_G^H$ term represents the rate at which Tyrosine reacts with Tyrosine Hydroxylase to create L-DOPA, hence this term is seen again in (11) as a positive term. The reaction rate is modeled (simply) with the law of mass action where $\alpha_1$ is the constant of proportionality. Next the transport of Tyrosine out of the gut through the gastrointestinal wall is modeled with Michaelis Menten Kinetics. The [Other] term represents..................  $T_G$

\todo{Delete Others and Explain Why}
%We chose to ignore these variables because "x"

represents the initial amount of Tyrosine found in the gut at time t=0. Since Tyrosine is a nonessential amino acid there is a metabolic rate modeled by.... I feel like we could/should pick a term for this [Metabolic Rate] since it shouldn't be too difficult. \\
\indent Equation (11) models the production, usage, and transport of L-DOPA in the gut and into the blood stream The reaction rate term of Tyrosine with Tyrosine Hydroxylase is seen again along with another Michaelis Menten term modeling the transport of L-DOPA through the gastrointestinal wall and into the blood stream.

\subsection{Renal System}
%Yes. We're doing the Renal System, but the equations needs to be modified. I copied the G.I. equations as a place holder.  
L-DOPA is synthesized en-masse into Dopamine within the renal system which then leaves the body via urination.  Thus the Renal System is the basis of our hypothesis of too much L-DOPA leaving the system, dependent on too much or too little salt.  If too much Dopamine is synthesized within the kidneys too little L-DOPA is left within the Circulatory System to travel to and through the blood brain barrier in order to reach the Dopaminergic Pathways, the Nigrostriatal Pathway in particular.  Currently insufficient L-DOPA remaining due to renal processes is an unexplored hypothesis for the cause and severity of Parkinson's Disease.

The amount of L-DOPA in the blood stream comes from two sources, L-DOPA traveling through the gut wall into the blood stream as well as Tyrosine reacting with Tyrosine Hydroxylase in the blood stream itself, creating L-DOPA. This is seen in the first two terms, where the second term, $\frac{\alpha_2 T_G}{\alpha_3 + T_G} \cdot T_{BL}^H$, comes from the amount of Tyrosine traveling into the blood stream acting by the law of mass action with the amount of Tyrosine Hydroxylase, $T_{BL}^H$.L-DOPA then moves out of the blood stream and through the blood brain barrier with the help of its transport protein, this process is modeled using Michaelis Menten.L-DOPA is also transported out of the blood stream into other areas of the body (Not sure if true or not, but probably) as well as reacting with AADC-B6 to create Dopamine. However, due to Dopamine's lack of a transport protein, our model will not focus on Dopamine produced outside of the brain.\cite{Ref33} Hence the [Other] term.

Tyrosine's concentration in the blood is modeled similarly. The L-DOPA being created and modeled with Michaelis Menten and law of mass action is seen again in equation (15) as a negative term for the Tyrosine concentration. Tyrosine is also being brought into the blood from the gut through the gut wall which is again modeled with Michaelis Menten. I'm not sure what the two [Other] terms represent.

\subsection{Central Nervous System}

The concentration of L-DOPA in the brain is dependent on the Michaelis Menten term of L-DOPA traveling from the blood, though the blood-brain barrier and into the brain. The creation rate of Dopamine from L-DOPA reacting with AADC-B6 is modeled using law of mass action as seen in the - $\alpha_8 \cdot L_{BR} \cdot A$ term. The [Other] term represents decay rate only? 
\quad The concentration of Dopamine is finally being modeled now in equation (17) where we see the law of mass action term representing the creation of Dopamine in the brain as well as the $- \frac{\text{decay}}{\text{usage}}$ term represnting the short lifespan of Dopamine (source) as well as Dopamine now traveling into the Dopaminergic pathways as well as being used to create other neurotransmitters such as Norepinephrine and Epinephrine.

\subsection{Introduction}
Studies have show that the synthesis of dopamine in the renal system is both up and down regulated by salt.  Our bifurcation diagram
%----------------------------- Figure 2 -----------------------------------
 \ref{fig:2} %????????????????                                       %Figure
also shows at certain values $\gamma_1 \text{ and } \gamma_2$ the system becomes unstable.  It is our speculation that this confirms what studies have show and is due to the influences of salt within the renal system. This is: the system is only stable within certain boundary conditions.  $$\text{ unstable  } \le \gamma_1 \le \text{ stable } \le \gamma_2 \le \text{ unstable }$$

"The foregoing scenario would be expected to result in hypertension, normal baseline proximal and distal sodium reabsorption, normal (nonsuppressed) plasma renin activity, and increased GFR and RBF. In response to D1-like receptor agonist (eg, fenoldopam) administration at a dose that does not alter blood pressure, one would expect no reduction in proximal tubule sodium reabsorption, a major decrease in distal tubule sodium reabsorption due to “unopposed” or upregulated D1 and D5 receptors, and natriuresis. These are precisely the baseline and D1-like receptor agonist responses that have been demonstrated in patients with salt-sensitive hypertension".\cite{Ref30} 

"This effect was distinct from the renal vasodilator action of exogenous dopamine that depended on increased concentrations of circulating dopamine." \cite{Ref32}

As noted future studies addressing the specific dopamine receptor defect(s) in patients with genetic predisposition for salt-sensitive hypertension and in hypertensives themselves will be important to clarify the role of the renal dopamine system in the pathogenesis of \cite{Ref16} Parkinson's disease.

 In our first simulation all systems begin at $t_0 = 0 \text{ sec}$ and end at $t_1 = 2 \text{ sec}$  It is immediately apparent that the circulatory system is highly dependent upon the initial values given to the intermediate complex, enzyme and substrates within the renal system as shown in Figure

\subsection{Future Goals}
\textbf{EXAMPLE: TAKEN FROM RENAL HYPERTENSION ARTICLE}
The foregoing scenario would be expected to result in
hypertension, normal baseline proximal and distal sodium reabsorption, normal (nonsuppressed) plasma renin activity, and increased GFR and RBF. In response to D1-like receptor agonist (eg, fenoldopam) administration at a dose that does not alter blood pressure, one would expect no reduction in proximal tubule sodium reabsorption, a major decrease in distal tubule sodium reabsorption due to “unopposed” or upregulated D1 and D5 receptors, and natriuresis. These are precisely the baseline and D1-like receptor agonist responses that have been demonstrated in patients with salt-sensitive hypertension.74 Future studies addressing the specific dopa- mine receptor defect(s) in patients with genetic predisposition for salt-sensitive hypertension and in hypertensives them- selves will be important to clarify the role of the renal dopamine system in the pathogenesis of hypertension." \cite{Ref16}
%~~~~~~Subsection 8.4~~~~~~
\subsection{Final Thoughts}
\textbf{EXAMPLE: TAKEN FROM RENAL HYPERTENSION ARTICLE}
"Physiological Analysis of a Dopaminergic Defect in Hypertension
In light of the present evidence (summarized above), it is likely that a substantial number of patients with essential hypertension may have a selective proximal tubule defect wherein there is absent D1 receptor–G protein coupling, leading to increased proximal tubule sodium reabsorption, extracellular fluid volume expansion, and increased blood pressure (Figure 4). This defect may be due to inactivation of D1 receptors secondary to hyperphosphorylation, to defective receptor cycling, or both. The increase in blood pressure should cause a reduction in baseline proximal sodium reab- sorption to normal via pressure natriuresis. The initial in- crease in proximal tubule sodium reabsorption should de- crease distal tubule sodium delivery, which should decrease afferent arteriolar resistance, due to tubuloglomerular feed- back mechanisms, leading to an increase in RBF and GFR. Decreased distal tubule sodium delivery also should increase renin secretion, which would not be expected to be entirely suppressed by the increase in blood pressure. Increased blood pressure would normalize both proximal and distal tubule sodium reabsorption, but at the expense of increased blood pressure." \cite{Ref16}
